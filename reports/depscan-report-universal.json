The protocol does not require the client and server to coordinate the cancellation in any way, the client may do it unilaterally. The client may also assume that the cancellation will take effect immediately when the server receives the RST_STREAM frame, before any other data from that TCP connection is processed.\n\nAbuse of this feature is called a Rapid Reset attack because it relies on the ability for an endpoint to send a RST_STREAM frame immediately after sending a request frame, which makes the other endpoint start working and then rapidly resets the request. The request is canceled, but leaves the HTTP/2 connection open. \n\nThe HTTP/2 Rapid Reset attack built on this capability is simple: The client opens a large number of streams at once as in the standard HTTP/2 attack, but rather than waiting for a response to each request stream from the server or proxy, the client cancels each request immediately.\n\nThe ability to reset streams immediately allows each connection to have an indefinite number of requests in flight. By explicitly canceling the requests, the attacker never exceeds the limit on the number of concurrent open streams. The number of in-flight requests is no longer dependent on the round-trip time (RTT), but only on the available network bandwidth.\n\nIn a typical HTTP/2 server implementation, the server will still have to do significant amounts of work for canceled requests, such as allocating new stream data structures, parsing the query and doing header decompression, and mapping the URL to a resource. For reverse proxy implementations, the request may be proxied to the backend server before the RST_STREAM frame is processed. The client on the other hand paid almost no costs for sending the requests. This creates an exploitable cost asymmetry between the server and the client.\n\nMultiple software artifacts implementing HTTP/2 are affected. This advisory was originally ingested from the `swift-nio-http2` repo advisory and their original conent follows.\n\n## swift-nio-http2 specific advisory\nswift-nio-http2 is vulnerable to a denial-of-service vulnerability in which a malicious client can create and then reset a large number of HTTP/2 streams in a short period of time. This causes swift-nio-http2 to commit to a large amount of expensive work which it then throws away, including creating entirely new `Channel`s to serve the traffic. This can easily overwhelm an `EventLoop` and prevent it from making forward progress.\n\nswift-nio-http2 1.28 contains a remediation for this issue that applies reset counter using a sliding window. This constrains the number of stream resets that may occur in a given window of time. Clients violating this limit will have their connections torn down. This allows clients to continue to cancel streams for legitimate reasons, while constraining malicious actors.\n\n## Related CVE(s)\nBIT-apisix-2023-44487, BIT-aspnet-core-2023-44487,

The specific exploit requires the application to run on Tomcat as a WAR deployment. If the application is deployed as a Spring Boot executable jar, i.e. the default, it is not vulnerable to the exploit. However, the nature of the vulnerability is more general, and there may be other ways to exploit it.\n\nThese are the prerequisites for the exploit:\n- JDK 9 or higher\n- Apache Tomcat as the Servlet container\n- Packaged as WAR\n- `spring-webmvc` or `spring-webflux` dependency\n\n## Patches\n\n- Spring Framework [5.3.18](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/releases/tag/v5.3.18) and [5.2.20](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/releases/tag/v5.2.20.RELEASE)\n- Spring Boot [2.6.6](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/releases/tag/v2.6.6) and [2.5.12](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/releases/tag/v2.5.12)\n\n## Workarounds\n\nFor those who are unable to upgrade, leaked reports recommend setting `disallowedFields` on `WebDataBinder` through an `@ControllerAdvice`. This works generally, but as a centrally applied workaround fix, may leave some loopholes, in particular if a controller sets `disallowedFields` locally through its own `@InitBinder` method, which overrides the global setting.\n\nTo apply the workaround in a more fail-safe way, applications could extend `RequestMappingHandlerAdapter` to update the `WebDataBinder` at the end after all other initialization. In order to do that, a Spring Boot application can declare a `WebMvcRegistrations` bean (Spring MVC) or a `WebFluxRegistrations` bean (Spring WebFlux).\n\n            ", "related_urls": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-22965", "https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/commit/002546b3e4b8d791ea6acccb81eb3168f51abb15", "https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-254054.pdf", "https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/releases/tag/v2.5.12", "https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/releases/tag/v2.6.6", "https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework", "https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/releases/tag/v5.2.20.RELEASE", "https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/releases/tag/v5.3.18", "https://psirt.global.sonicwall.com/vuln-detail/SNWLID-2022-0005", "https://spring.io/blog/2022/03/31/spring-framework-rce-early-announcement", "https://tanzu.vmware.com/security/cve-2022-22965", "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-java-spring-rce-Zx9GUc67", "https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuapr2022.html", "https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujul2022.html", "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/166713/Spring4Shell-Code-Execution.html", "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/167011/Spring4Shell-Spring-Framework-Class-Property-Remote-Code-Execution.html"]}

Most users will not use it to perform arbitrary XSLT transformations.\n\nUsers running XSLT transformations with untrusted stylesheets should explicitly use XMLUnit's APIs to pass in a pre-configured TraX `TransformerFactory` with extension functions disabled via features and attributes.
